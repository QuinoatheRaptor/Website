    <h1>Calculator</h1>

    <p>A calculator I designed to practice using HTML, PHP, and CSS.</p>

    <h1>Features</h1>

    <p>This calculator lets a user enter two numbers into a text box and perform a simple operation on them. It also has two buttons that allow the user to copy their last answer into either of the text boxes (you can't copy it into both at the same time though). The calculator also features a bit of CSS to make it look a bit more like a real calculator.</p>
