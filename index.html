        <h1>My Programming Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Joaquin Fernandez. Welcome to my portfolio of my proudest coding projects on github. 
            I am currently a sophomore in college studying Computer Science at Benedictine College. 
            My favorite projects to code are text-based games and simulations.</p><br>
        <p>Every link below will take you to a new page with a link to the project's github as well as videos showing 
            some of the most important features of each project. Feel free to look around and see all the cool things I've made!
        </p>

        <h2>Java Projects</h2>
        <p>Java is the first language I learned and the language I'm most comfortable with. All my most complex projects thus far have been done in Java.</p>
        <h3><a href="tictactoe.html">Tic Tac Toe Program</a></h3>
        <p>A simple program that simulates a game of Tic Tac Toe. The user can play against one of three difficulties of bots or another user.</p>
        <h3><a href="racingleague.html">Racing Season Simulator</a></h3>
        <p>An in-depth program that simulates a full season of a racing league, keeping track of team and individual points.</p>

        <h2>C++ Projects</h2>
        <p>With my dream job being game design, I began learning C++ and trying to make some projects in it.</p>
        <h3><a href="coinflipper.html">Infinite Coin Flipper</a></h3>
        <p>The Infinite Coin Flipper was my first personal C++ project, designed to run some experiments in probability. It simulates flipping a coin as many times as you want and tracks some statistics about the flips.</p>
        <h3><a href="montecarlo.html">Monte Carlo War</a></h3>
        <p>Monte Carlo War was my first larger C++ project. It simulates a variation on the card game War that allows the players to bet a certain number of cards to win or lose during a war.</p>

        <h2>Python Projects</h2>
        <p>Having learned Java first I generally prefer it to Python. However, I've found Python to be practical for smaller projects and want to improve my proficiency with it.</p>
        <h3><a href="elevator.html">Elevator</a></h3>
        <p>Simple code to simulate the decision-making of an elevator as it tries to get everyone where they want to go.</p>

        <h2>HTML/CSS/PHP Projects</h2>
        <p>I haven't done any personal projects with web design coding languages (besides this portfolio) but I plan to in the future to improve the usability of some of my other projects.
            None of my web projects are currently on public websites so the php ones (i.e. all of them) will need to be run using a local virtual machine.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="calculator.html">Calculator</a></h3>
        <p>A simple php calculator that can do some basic operations.</p>
